# Capstone | Salt & Hash

_Tinder-inspired event venue voting app_

Created by a team of developers during the [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/) at Fullstack Academy during a 3-week sprint, **Salt & Hash** is an iOS/Android app that allows friend groups to vote on restaurants for organized events. This project included an opportunity to learn and practice React Native from scratch, and if fully completed and deployed, would include supremely more complex location-based searching and filtering options for individuals hosting events (the current structure being a limitation of the Google Places' API) as well as cleaner, DRY-er architecture for the recycling of certain components.

Hosts create an event, select restaurants in their nearby location, and invite friends to RSVP and vote over text; invited guests register for an account, and cast their votes on a hostâ€™s selected restaurants. Once the voting deadline passes, a restaurant is listed for the event.

(This app was never formally deployed.)

## Tech Stack

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - library for building user interfaces
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - framework for building native apps using React
* [Expo](https://expo.io/) - open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React
* [Firebase](firebase.google.com) - cloud real-time NoSQL database, authorization framework
* [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) - service that returns info about places using HTTP requests

## Installation

After you fork and clone the repo, establish a Firebase project, introducing your database info into a src/firebase/config.js file, and a Google Places API, introducing the API into a secrets.js file.
